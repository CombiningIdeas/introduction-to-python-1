### The beginning of the journey to IT

+ This repository was created exclusively for storing my old console programs in Python. :file_folder:
+ I was solving all these tasks in Python in 2022, when I was just getting acquainted with programming. :heart:
+ I posted this repository for storage on Github as a backup. :arrow_up:

This repository has no practical use and is only needed for storing data, but those who are 
interested in it can familiarize themselves with it and study the tasks that I solved in it. :white_check_mark:
